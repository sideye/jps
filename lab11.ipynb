    "Welcome to lab 11! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will investigate how economic stimulus payments in the form of tax rebates affect household consumption. This lab is based on *Household Expenditure and the Income Tax Rebates of 2001* by David S. Johnson, Jonathan A Parker, and Nicholas S Souleles (which we will refer to as the JPS study for short). \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001, the Bush administration passed the *Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001*, which mainly  reduced the rates of individual income taxes. In addition, the bill initiated a series of one-time rebates for all taxpayers that filed a tax return for 2000. The payment of these rebates were broadly announced, so that most households were aware of an incoming stimulus payment (much similar to the recent stimulus check). The rebate was as follows:\n",
    "- Up to a maximum of \\$300 for single filers with no dependents\n",
    "- Up to a maximum of \\$500 for single parents\n",
    "- Up to a maximum of \\$600 for married couples\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in determining how individuals altered their consumption patterns due to the economic stimulus payments, and by extent see if the permanent income hypothesis holds. The permanent income hypothesis states that consumers attempt to smooth their consumption across their life time, so that \"changes in permanent income, rather than changes in temporary income, are what drive the changes in a consumer's consumption patterns.\" Intuitively, if the permanent income hypothesis were to hold, we would expect households to smooth out the spending of the rebate even before the rebate arrived. Thus, their consunmption would not change much between periods since they had known in the previous period that they would be receiving a sizable increase in income in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, these stimulus payments were assigned to households at random periods in time, which allows us to better conclude a causal effect of a one time cash payment on changes in consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the true causal effect, we will use least squares regression. JPS propose the following regression for any household relating the stimulus payment to change in consumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{t+1} - C_t = \\sum_s \\beta_{0,s} \\text{month}_s + \\beta_1 \\text{age} + \\beta_2 \\text{$\\Delta$ children} + \\beta_3 \\text{$\\Delta$ adults} + \\beta_4 \\text{Stimulus Payment}_{t+1} + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we control for seasonal effects by creating dummy variables for each period (measured in months), and also control for changes in the number of children and adults in a household. Let's consider a few scenarios in context of the regression to gain some intuition:\n",
    "- If a household received a stimulus in period $t+1$, then the change in consumption ($C_{t+1} - C_t$) due to the rebate should be captured by $\\beta_4$ if we have sufficiently controlled for all potential factors of change in consumption between the 2 periods. \n",
    "- If a household did not receive a stimulus payment in $t+1$, then the stimulus payment will be 0. Thus, the change in consumption will only be explained by our control variables: age, changes in family members, and seasonal variation. \n",

    "One potential issue with the JPS study is that households who received a period in period $t$ but not in $t+1$ will have the same $\\text{Stimulus Payment}_{t+1}$ value as households who did not receive a stimulus payment at all. This may not be the case - intuitively we might expect consumption to decrease if a payment was issued in the previous period but not the current period. Instead, we will implement an added variable on whether a household received stimulus payment in period $t$ to better control for the causal effect of a stimulus payment on changes in consumption. \n",

    "- If a household did not receive a stimulus payment in $t+1$ or $t$, then both stimulus payment variables will be 0. Thus, the change in consumption will only be explained by our control variables: age, changes in family members, and seasonal variation. \n",

We made multiple design choices in each model and could have made many other adjustments as well. For example, we could have determined changes in log consumption, controlled for more variables, or only regressed on households that received a stimulus payment. \n",

With a p-value of 5%, we would expect to see statistically significant results even if the null hypothesis were true 1 in 20 times. Thus, even if the null hypothesis were true, a model may produce statistically significant results if we ran enough variations of the model."
